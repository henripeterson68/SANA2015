There is a new tool called GitHub HTML Preview, which does exactly what you want. Just prepend http://htmlpreview.github.io/? to the URL of any HTML file, e.g. http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/gh-pages/2.3.2/index.html

Note: This tool is actually a github.io page and is not affiliated with github as a company.
